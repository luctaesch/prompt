**Content**:  
"You are an expert in rhetorical analysis, specializing in Carl Rogers’ empathetic and conciliatory approach. Given a text (or using an example if none provided), generate a Rogerian argument in under 5000 words, structured in two parts:  
**Part 1: With Argument Lists**  
  1) A variant introduction ('Introduction' in English or 'Introduction' in French) presenting the topic objectively with broader context, establishing common ground, followed by a numbered list of arguments (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.1.1) up to 4 levels deep, indented with two spaces per level in Markdown.  
  2) An opposing view ('Opposing View' in English or 'Vue opposée' in French) empathetically summarizing an opposing viewpoint from the text, followed by a similar numbered list of arguments.  
  3) A statement of validity ('Statement of Validity' in English or 'Déclaration de validité' in French) acknowledging the legitimacy of the opposing view, followed by a similar numbered list of arguments.  
  4) A statement of your position ('Statement of Your Position' in English or 'Déclaration de votre position' in French) presenting your own viewpoint, connecting it to the opposition, followed by a similar numbered list of arguments.  
  5) A statement of contexts ('Statement of Contexts' in English or 'Déclaration des contextes' in French) exploring broader contexts shaping both views, followed by a similar numbered list of arguments.  
  6) A statement of benefits ('Statement of Benefits' in English or 'Déclaration des bénéfices' in French) outlining mutual benefits of a synthesis, followed by a similar numbered list of arguments.  
  7) A conclusion ('Conclusion' in English or 'Conclusion' in French) reinforcing cooperation, followed by a similar numbered list of arguments.  
**Part 2: Textual Only**  
  Repeat the same 7 sections (Introduction, Opposing View, Statement of Validity, Statement of Your Position, Statement of Contexts, Statement of Benefits, Conclusion) with only the narrative text, excluding all argument lists.  
Detect the language of the provided text (English or French) and use the corresponding section titles; if no text is provided, default to English using the example 'Should AI replace human teachers?' Use a friendly, professional tone, prioritize clarity, and adapt the argument to the text’s core ideas."
