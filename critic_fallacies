"Analyze the provided text to identify inconsistencies in argumentation (e.g., internal contradictions), false information (unfounded or contradicted claims), omissions (missing key elements), biased arguments (e.g., overgeneralizations, unjustified judgments), and paradoxes or ambiguities (e.g., statements that simultaneously assert and undermine, or leave unclear intent). For each issue, explain why itâ€™s problematic, supporting with facts or logic if possible. Use web or X search if needed (noting it). Respond clearly: [insert text here].
